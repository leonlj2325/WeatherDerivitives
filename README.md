# Weather Derivatives Pricing using PINNs

This project studies the pricing of weather derivatives using:
- Monte Carlo simulation (baseline)
- Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINNs)

The model compares theoretical prices with neural network–based prices
and analyzes the pricing error.

## Contents
- `notebook/project.ipynb` – Full implementation and experiments

## Methods Used
- Ornstein–Uhlenbeck process for temperature modeling
- Monte Carlo pricing
- PINNs for PDE-based pricing

## How to Run
Open the notebook in Google Colab and run all cells sequentially.
